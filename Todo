Make update fontawesome for skills through a dropdown not an insert the key

add skill: choose images or icons as in whatever is populated in the db

Add
Remove 
Update
Images

Confirm the minimum requirements for adding anything

JS to fix the javascript and get the gps location in it
number of portfolio pieces per category: maybe add a "value" param to the portfoilio category
increment it on add of a portfolio piece to a category
decrement on delete of a portfoilio piece

remove a category ends the filtering for that category unless you rewrite it exactly the same

portfolio item needs image fields or a joint table or something

in home.blade.php
if the user inputs a content_title_1 with no content_text_1 then the numbering gets off for the tabs

entity->webiste needs to be in format: www.webiste.com not http://www.website.com

php contact form needs to link to entity->email

add deleted at to all queries so that the people accessing the db can only add/update they can't do any deletes

Material->form_components button to lcikc here to edit the following content would be sick
